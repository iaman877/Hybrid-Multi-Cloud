Topic : Differences between public and private cloud | Need of terraform 

  * In order to utilize current techinal world  services we need  API(Application Programming Interface) that runs behind:
           1)WebUi   2)Mobileapps  3)CLI   4)SDK.
* But now-a-days the world turned to multicloud(Using more than one cloud) ,why because of the different specifications 
        for different services in different clouds some services might be cheap in one cloud ,some might be faster.
* while we are going for multi-cloud we cant spend our  money and time to learn all the clouds .so we require a standard tool       that can manage all clouds. The such standard tool we have now is Terraform.
* Terraform: Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. Configuration files describe to Terraform the components      needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter.
